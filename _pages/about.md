Hello! 

I am KC (Kaustubh Chakradeo), and I am a PhD fellow at the University of Copenhagen at the Section of Epidemiology, Department of Public Health. My PhD is based on deep learning based medical imaging analysis. I run two main projects- the first is prediction of malaria in sub-Saharan Africa using satellite images with deep learning. The second project is prediction of biological age, disease prediction, and survival analysis of healthy patients from their digitised skin biopsy samples, using self supervised deep learning techniques. 

Besides these, my main academic interests are using imaging and artificial intelligence, AI ethics and algorithmic fairness. In imaging, my main focus is various modalities of medical imagery like radiology (MRI scans, mammography, CT scans) and histopathology. I am interested in projects for using AI for minorities. Besides this, I am also interested in the AI Act 2024. I graduated with a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at Radboud University, the Netherlands.

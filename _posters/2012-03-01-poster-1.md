Abstract- In 2021, there were 247 million malaria cases globally, with the majority of cases in sub-Saharan Africa. Using remote sensing combined with unsupervised deep learning techniques 
can help effectively predict the prevalence of malaria, using geographical features like forest
cover, proximity to water, urban density and much more. With the help of contrastive learning, we can follow the trend of malaria in Africa over three decades.

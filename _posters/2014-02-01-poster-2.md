Abstract- We use a self-supervised contrastive deep learning model to extract ageing-related features from digitised skin biopsies of healthy patients to predict three critical aspects of that  individual- the age of the individual, the risk of some diseases at the time of biopsy, and
the risk of mortality in the next twenty years after the biopsy.
